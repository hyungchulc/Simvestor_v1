# SimVestor UI/UX Fixes - July 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. üìà Chart Legend & Display
**Problem**: Chart legend was weird, percentage return chart was confusing
**Solution**: 
- Reverted to investment value chart showing dollar amounts
- Removed legend for cleaner appearance
- Single line showing investment value over time
- Better hover information with both value and return percentage

### 2. üìÖ Year-over-Year Comparison
**Problem**: User requested 2024 vs 2025 comparison chart
**Solution**:
- Added new `create_yearly_comparison_chart()` function
- Shows normalized returns from year start for both 2024 and 2025
- Side-by-side comparison on same chart
- Only displays if sufficient data available for both years

### 3. üìä Improved Metrics Layout
**Problem**: Layout was cluttered and confusing
**Solution**:
- **Two rows of metrics**: Main performance + Additional insights
- **Row 1**: Total Return, Final Value, Volatility, Max Drawdown
- **Row 2**: Annualized Return, Sharpe Ratio, Days Invested, Initial Price
- Better visual organization with clear section headers

### 4. ‚ÑπÔ∏è Company Information Placement
**Problem**: Company info appeared at bottom, duplicated sections
**Solution**:
- **Moved company info** right after Data Quality Report
- **Removed duplicate** company info section at bottom
- Better information flow: Data Quality ‚Üí Company Info ‚Üí Performance

### 5. ü§ñ AI Insights Clarification
**Problem**: User asked where AI insights come from
**Solution**:
- Added caption: "*Generated from technical analysis, volatility, and performance metrics*"
- Clarifies that insights are algorithmic, not from external AI services
- Based on calculated indicators like RSI, moving averages, volatility, etc.

### 6. üì∞ News State Management
**Problem**: News refresh would reset/clear results
**Solution**:
- **Fixed state persistence**: News stays cached per ticker
- **Improved refresh logic**: Only updates when explicitly requested
- **Better error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for empty news
- **Removed st.rerun()**: Prevents unwanted page refreshes

### 7. üìä S&P 500 Comparison State
**Problem**: S&P 500 comparison would reset to homepage
**Solution**:
- **Ticker-specific state keys**: `comparison_results_{ticker}` and `benchmark_data_{ticker}`
- **Unique button keys**: Prevents state conflicts between different simulations
- **Persistent comparison charts**: Results stay visible until new comparison

### 8. üé® Visual Improvements
**Solution**:
- **Consistent spacing**: Added dividers and better section breaks
- **Clear section headers**: Performance Summary, Analysis Options, etc.
- **Better color scheme**: Dark mode compatible throughout
- **Responsive layout**: Works well on different screen sizes

## Technical Implementation

- `create_yearly_comparison_chart()`: 2024 vs 2025 comparison

### Key Changes:
- **State Management**: Ticker-specific keys prevent cross-contamination
