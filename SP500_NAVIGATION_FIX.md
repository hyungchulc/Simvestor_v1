# S&P 500 Comparison - Navigation Fix

## Issue Fixed
**Problem**: When clicking "📊 Compare vs S&P 500" button, the app would redirect to the main page instead of staying on the results page and showing the comparison.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by `st.rerun()` being called after a successful S&P 500 comparison, which refreshes the entire Streamlit app and resets the simulation state.

```python
# PROBLEMATIC CODE:
st.success("✅ Benchmark comparison completed!")
st.rerun()  # This caused the page to reset to main screen
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed `st.rerun()` from S&P 500 Button
**File**: `/Users/dtive/MacOnly/Simvestor/app.py`

```python
# FIXED CODE:
st.success("✅ Benchmark comparison completed! Scroll down to see results.")
# Removed st.rerun() - comparison shows immediately below
```

### 2. Removed `st.rerun()` from Clear Button
```python
# BEFORE:
st.success("Comparison cleared!")
st.rerun()

# AFTER:
st.success("Comparison cleared! The results will disappear on next interaction.")
```

### 3. Enhanced Visual Separation
Added visual anchor with divider for better UX:
```python
# Add anchor for smooth scrolling/navigation
st.markdown("---")
st.subheader("📊 S&P 500 Benchmark Comparison")
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Click "📊 Compare vs S&P 500"** → Fetches data and stores in session state
2. **Success message appears** → "Benchmark comparison completed! Scroll down to see results."
3. **Comparison section renders below** → Shows metrics and chart immediately
4. **No page refresh** → User stays on the same results page

## User Experience Improvement

### ✅ **Before (Broken)**
1. Click S&P 500 comparison button
2. Page refreshes and goes to main screen
3. User loses current simulation results
4. Must re-run simulation to see results

### ✅ **After (Fixed)**
1. Click S&P 500 comparison button
2. Shows loading spinner
3. Success message appears
4. Comparison results display below (same page)
5. User can scroll down to see full comparison

## State Management

The comparison results are stored in session state with ticker-specific keys:
- `comparison_results_{ticker}`: Contains alpha, returns, volatility data
- `benchmark_data_{ticker}`: Contains S&P 500 historical data

This ensures:
- Results persist across user interactions
- Multiple ticker comparisons don't interfere
- Clear separation between different stocks

## Testing Steps

1. **Run simulation** for any ticker (e.g., AAPL, NVDA)
2. **Click "📊 Compare vs S&P 500"**
3. **Verify**: Page stays on results, no redirect to main
4. **Scroll down**: See comparison metrics and chart
5. **Click "🗑️ Clear Comparison"**: Results disappear on next interaction

## Technical Notes

- **No page refreshes**: All state changes happen in memory
- **Immediate feedback**: Success/error messages appear instantly
- **Persistent state**: Results remain until manually cleared
- **Visual guidance**: Clear instructions on where to find results

The S&P 500 comparison now works seamlessly without any unwanted page redirects or state resets.
